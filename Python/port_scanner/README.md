# Port Scanner 

A simple port scanner designed to check the open ports of a specified target. It takes an IP address as a command-line argument, scans ports 50 to 85, and prints the results, indicating whether each port is open or closed. The script provides a timestamped banner, making it easy to understand when the scanning process started.
