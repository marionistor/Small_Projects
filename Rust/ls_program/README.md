# ls program

A simple Rust program that mimics the basic functionality of the 'ls' command. It accepts optional command-line arguments to specify the directory to be listed; otherwise, it defaults to the current directory. The program then prints the contents of the specified directory, indicating whether each item is a directory, file, or link, along with their respective permissions and paths.
